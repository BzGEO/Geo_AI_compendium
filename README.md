## Overview

1. Objectives
2. Schematics
3. Resources: Machine learning (traditional)
4. Resources: Deep learning
5. Resources: Uncertainty / accuracy assessment
6. Resources: Other

## 1. Objectives

* Document the various Machine Learning approaches available across various [desktop + cloud] platforms (e.g. [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview), [ENVI](https://www.nv5geospatialsoftware.com/Products/ENVI), [ERDAS Imagine](https://hexagon.com/products/erdas-imagine), [GEE](https://code.earthengine.google.com/), [QGIS](https://qgis.org/),[R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [SNAP](https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/), [TerrSet](https://github.com/ClarkCGA/terrset))
  * Compile resources (including tutorials and sample scripts) regarding how to implement those approaches in the platforms listed ⬆️
  * Understand how to replicate ML workflows from one platform to another
* Understand the limitations of the various ML approaches 🤔
  * Push the limits of the various approaches
  * *For instance, what determines the taste of the cake? The quality of the ingredients used, or the technique of the baker?* 🤔

## 2. Schematics

* Overview of the distinctions between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)
