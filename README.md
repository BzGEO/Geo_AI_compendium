## 1. Objectives

* Document the various Machine Learning approaches available across various [desktop + cloud] platforms (e.g. ArcGIS, ENVI, GEE, QGIS, SNAP, TerrSet)
  * Compile resources (including tutorials and sample scripts) regarding how to implement each approach in different platforms
  * Understand how to replicate ML workflows from one platform to another
* Understand the limitations of the various ML approaches
  * Push the limits of the various approaches
* What determines the taste of the cake? The quality of the ingredients used, or the technique of the baker? ü§î
