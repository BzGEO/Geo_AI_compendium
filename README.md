## 1. Objectives

* Document the various Machine Learning approaches available across various [desktop + cloud] platforms (e.g. ArcGIS, ENVI, GEE, QGIS, SNAP, TerrSet)
  * Compile resources (including tutorials and sample scripts) regarding how to implement each approach in different platforms
  * Understand how to replicate ML workflows from one platform to another
* Understand the limitations of the various ML approaches
  * Push the limits of the various approaches
* What determines the taste of the cake? The quality of the ingredients used, or the technique of the baker? ü§î

## 2. Schematics

* Overview of the distinctions between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)


* Overview of various tools for doing ML (‚Äú[SciKit-Learn algorithm cheat sheet](https://scikit-learn.org/1.4/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html)‚Äù):


* Complementary overview of available ML tools:
